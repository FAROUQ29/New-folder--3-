   <p> If you are reading this I want you to know that this isn't a serious paragrph.<b>I want to mark this certain phrase starting from the last capital letter to the coming full stop.</b>  I'm just trying to form a long paragraph. And as such I don't know what to type I'm only trying to pretend as if it's something serious. Well I'm trying to practice a tag. I think that's enough, lemme now go to the main thing.
